Gene Expression Analysis: Gene expression analysis provides quantitative information about the population of RNA species in cells and tissues
High-throughput technologies to measure global gene expression levels started with Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and are widely used with microarray and RNA-seq
For gene expression we are taking GEO database and my case study has Cervical cancer type of RNA sequence which I have collected from NCBI GEO database

Normalization of Data:
Differential expression analysis means taking the normalised read count data and performing statistical analysis to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups.
For example, we use statistical testing to decide whether, for a given gene, an observed difference in read counts is significant, that is, whether it is greater than what would be expected just due to natural random variation.

Volcano Plot:
A volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P value) versus magnitude of change (fold change). It enables quick visual identification of genes with large fold changes that are also statistically significant. These may be the most biologically significant genes. In a volcano plot, the most upregulated genes are towards the right, the most downregulated genes are towards the left, and the most statistically significant genes are towards the top.
